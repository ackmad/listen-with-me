1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,800
See me hurt, but you don't judge

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,900
That right there is the scary feeling

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,640
Open and enclosing up again, I've been hurt, so I don't trust

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,250
Now, here we are staring at the ceiling

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,350
I've said those words before, but it was a lie

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,440
And if you decide to hear the times

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,540
Fall it is, see that it's wise

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,540
So hard to say

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,860
If all it is, say that it's wise

10
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:57,840
But you are poor, you go, say that it's wise

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:20,300
Almost every life, on a hand to life

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,780
When your hands are mine, it's like I'm holicking

13
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,720
It's a letter signed, I should speak for mine

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:39,490
I said those words before, but it was a lie

15
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,910
If all it is, say that it's wise

16
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:51,370
If all it is, say that it's wise

17
00:01:51,370 --> 00:02:26,750
But you are poor, you go, say that it's wise
