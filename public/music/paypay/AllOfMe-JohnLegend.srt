1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,720
What would I do without your smart mouth?

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,300
Drawin' me in and you kicking me out

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,940
God, my head spinning

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,860
No kidding, I can't pin you down

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,680
What's goin' on and that beautiful mind?

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,520
I'm your magical mystery right

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,300
And I'm so busy, don't know what hit me

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,870
But I'll be all right, my hands are burned

9
00:00:43,870 --> 00:01:03,640
A cause of hers and all your edges

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,860
Are your perfect imperfections

11
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:19,120
Give me all, I'll give my end and my beginning

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,820
Even when I lose, I'm winning

13
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,480
Cause I give you all

14
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,890
He times do I have to tell you

15
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,730
Even when you crying, you're beautiful to her

16
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:58,800
The world is unfore, you're my muse

17
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,700
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues

18
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,500
I can't stop singing, it's bringing in

19
00:02:07,500 --> 00:03:39,840
My rhythm, furs and all, even on confessions

20
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:51,070
Give me all, I'll give you all, I'll give you all
